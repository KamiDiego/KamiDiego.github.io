        <h3>Global story</h3>

         When Sony unveiled the Walkman in 1979, it transformed the way we see and experience the world as we move through it. The advent of portable music turned
         headphones from a stationary device for work or home to an ubiquitous accessory—the original wearable technology.
         A genuine crossover between engineering and fashion, headphones demonstrate the way in which technological advancement 
         has come to influence style in our culture—just count the number of Beats headphones on any subway or airplane. 
         Headphones have become a crucial mediator of IRL social space, too. 
         Anyone with a smartphone and a set of earbuds possesses the tools to build and rebuild ambient private spaces,sonically and even emotionally 
         removed from their physical location.
         From their earliest deployment as military technology to their constant presence in the modern street and workplace, 
         headphones’ perpetual relevance stems from the ability they give the wearer to isolate and create their own reality.
         We are now equipped to score our own movies

        <h3>What problem does headset solve?</h3>

        Football coaches can often be seen on the sidelines wearing either one earpiece or a full two-earpiece headset.
        Who are these coaches talking to, and why are they wearing the headset?
        Football coaches wear headsets to talk to other coaches in a higher position, such as a booth or in the stands.
        These coaches relay information to the coaches on the field, as they have a better vantage point of the game.
        On Friday (for high school games), Saturday (for college games),
        and Sunday (for NFL games), coaches can be seen pacing up and down the sideline with a headset on their heads.
        These headsets are mandatory for coaches for one reason: information.

            <h3>How to use it?</h3>

            Coaches on the field will have headsets that connect to coaches that are at a higher elevation point, most often a “booth.”
            In high school football, coaches may find themselves above one to the press box or even tucked in the corner of the 
            stands to give themselves a vantage point. Coaches cannot get the proper angle to see the complete picture of the offense 
            or defense from the sidelines. Like the view you see on TV, that’s the birds-eye view the coaches are looking to get.
            This view helps coaches break down the scheme and identify (faster) which player is not doing their job.            
            With the most recent installment of sideline technology, coaches can take the information they get in the booth and immediately 
            apply it to on-field visuals. In the booth, there’s often anywhere from 2-6 coaches who also have headsets on. 
            Their jobs are separated into offense, defense, special teams, and oftentimes, game management.

            <h3>Who are using this?</h3>

            It typically depends on the coach. Most coaches will have a frequency channel for their offense and one for their defense. 
            This way, the channel’s discussions are organized.
            Even so, head coaches may or may not be wearing a headset. Some head coaches are offensive and defensive coordinators. 
            In this case, they must have direct communication with the booth to make changes on the go.
            Other times, head coaches will manage the game and not have a headset. 
            This allows them to focus on time management, deal with the referees, and pump up their players.

            <h3>What can you expect?</h3>

            Depending on the system, 20+ coaches can be connected to the communication network. As mentioned above, most teams will have 2 channels, 
            one for offense and one for defense. However, too many coaches can mean a clogged channel. The best communication is short and direct communication. 
            Especially if the quarterback is trying to make adjustments at the line of scrimmage, the last thing you want is an offensive coordinator whose mind 
            is bogged down. Before purchasing headsets, we recommend you list out which coaches need headsets and which ones don’t. 
            Too many coaches on the headsets to listen to play calls is the easiest way to clog up communication.
            Also, as Nick Saban has been famously quoted, too much communication breaks down important communication.
             Coaches shouldn’t talk on the headset unless they absolutely need to. Coaches shouldn’t commentate on the game or provide useless 
             information to other coaches who are calling plays.

            <h3>Future of headsets</h3>

            Coaches wear headsets to effectively talk to other coaches on the sidelines and coaches in the booth. 
            Due to the noise factor and the large crowds that football draws, having headsets is important for coaches.
            It’s rare to see sidelines in high school, colleges, and professional leagues without heads. 
            The louder the stadium, the harder it is to hear, and the more necessary headsets become among coaches.
            Headsets play a major role in communication for coaches. Without headsets, adjustments wouldn’t be made at the rapid rate 
            at which they are made. Offenses and defenses would get exposed more frequently.
