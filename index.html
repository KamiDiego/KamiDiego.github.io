                Before this, goal-line technology was introduced in football,
                which helped determine if the ball crossed the goal line or not.
                It was only used when the referee could not rule a goal and
                to take a third opinion.

                Then later, VAR was first used in a friendly game between France and Italy,
                and after a promising experiment, a pitch-side monitor was used in the FIFA Club World Cup.
                The A-league was the first professional division to adopt VAR, with the MLS, Bundesliga,
                and Serie A succeeding the suit.

                VAR was first seen in an FA cup game in England, and La Liga got on board for the 2018-19 season,
                with the Premier League and even Champions League from the 2019/20 season onwards started using it
                for what FIFA refers to as game-changing decisions, such as goal validity, penalty kicks, red cards,
                and offsides.

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the world of sports is a byproduct of todays ability
                to collect detailed and timely data on athletes performances.
                In the context of sports technology, experts predict that AI will have
                the greatest impact on improving team outcomes and identifying more valued athletes
                around the world.

                Artificial intelligence and other algorithms aid in the decision-making process.
                The implementation of artificial intelligence could make projecting the outcomes
                of sporting events more accurate...

                In sports, there are many different types of wearable tech. Professional athletes and casual fitness lovers alike favour Fitbit smartwatches.
                These are appropriate for a broad variety of activities that need calorie, step, distance, pulse, and heart rate tracking.
                Other, more specialised instances of wearable technology include smart clothes. Heart rate, breathing activity, postures, pace, and weight distribution are all measured by athletic clothing.
                Instead of collecting perspiration, new clothing is meant to wick it away from the body through evaporation.
                Even lighter and flatter track shoes are made to achieve the ideal mix of grip and comfort.
